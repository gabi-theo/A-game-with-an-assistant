So you have a grid with 2 circles. You tell the computer the path that the black circle should follow in order to reach the green circle. You have to use in your sentence words like ('move up' or 'go up' or simply 'up'). When the black circle will be on the green circle, the computer can "prove" you that he learned the path :)
Have fun!
